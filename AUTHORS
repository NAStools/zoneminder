ZoneMinder - A Linux based camera monitoring and analysis tool.

This project was imagined and created by Philip Coombes in
September 2002, shortly after being burglarised of his power tools.
He can be contacted at philip.coombes@zoneminder.com

In early 2013 after nearly two years of no development,
the community reached out to Phil in an attempt to open up the
project.  With Phil's blessing, the code was migrated to github,
and the community took over the project.
