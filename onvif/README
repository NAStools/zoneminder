1. PURPOSE
----------

The files in this folder and its subfolders add ONVIF support to zoneminder. 
The ONVIF consortium (www.onvif.org) publishes the ONVIF specifications. These 
specifications describe ways of connecting to and communicating with network 
video devices. Hardware and software that adhere to these specifications are 
meant to be interoperable.


2. SUBFOLDERS
-------------

doc/      - Documentation
modules/  - perl modules necessary for SOAP communication
proxy/    - perl SOAP proxy modules generated according to the ONVIF 
            specifications
scripts/  - application logic
wsdl/     - (empty) this is only used during the proxy generation process


3. LICENSE
----------
Any files in this folder and its subfolders are published under the same 
license as this file if they do not carry additional license information.


4. PROXY GENERATION
-------------------

SOAP messages use XML format and need to comply to the schema expected by the 
receiver. While it is possible to build messages through string concatenation 
it is impractical for all but testing purposes.
Here we use SOAP proxy modules generated by the script wsdl2perl.pl from the 
SOAP::WSDL module (http://search.cpan.org/~mkutter/SOAP-WSDL-2.00.10/) 
version 2.00.10. 

A - Get the input files.

    Download these files and any web service (.wsdl) or schema (.xsd) 
    files referenced therein into the wsdl/ subfolder.

    http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver10/device/wsdl/devicemgmt.wsdl
    http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver10/media/wsdl/media.wsdl
    http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver20/ptz/wsdl/ptz.wsdl
    http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver20/analytics/wsdl/analytics.wsdl

    The complete list of files we have during build is:
    
    analytics.wsdl
    b-2.xsd
    bf-2.xsd
    br-2.xsd
    brw-2.wsdl
    bw-2.wsdl
    devicemgmt.wsdl
    media.wsdl
    onvif.xsd
    ptz.wsdl
    r-2.xsd
    rw-2.wsdl
    soap-envelop.xsd
    t-1.xsd
    wsdd-discovery-1.1-schema-os.xsd
    wsdd-discovery-1.1-wsdl-os.wsdl
    wsdiscovery-udp.wsdl
    wsdl11soap12.xsd
    wsdl.xsd
    wsnotification.wsdl
    xmlmime.xsd
    xop-include.xsd

B - Generate the proxy modules using these commands.

    wsdl2perl.pl -p ONVIF::Device:: -b proxy/lib file:wsdl/devicemgmt.wsdl
    wsdl2perl.pl -p ONVIF::Media:: -b proxy/lib file:wsdl/media.wsdl
    wsdl2perl.pl -p ONVIF::PTZ:: -b proxy/lib file:wsdl/ptz.wsdl
    wsdl2perl.pl -p ONVIF::Event:: -b proxy/lib file:wsdl/event.wsdl
    wsdl2perl.pl -p ONVIF::Analytics:: -b proxy/lib file:wsdl/analytics.wsdl
    wsdl2perl.pl -p WSDiscovery:: -b proxy/lib file:wsdl/wsdiscovery-udp.wsdl
    wsdl2perl.pl -p WSNotification:: -b proxy/lib file:wsdl/wsnotification.wsdl

    I had to tweak SOAP::WSDL a little bit to get correct proxies.
