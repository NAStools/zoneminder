HTTPS is now a requirement
==========================

This package now depends on Apache's mod_ssl pacakge. This will automatically
be installed along with ZoneMinder. Upon installation, the mod_ssl package
will create a default, self-signed certificate. This is the certificate that
ZoneMinder will use out of the box. 

Since the certificate is self-signed, you will get a warning from your browser
the first time you access the web portal. This is normal.

This is not intended to be an all encompasing solution for everyone. ZoneMinder
will work just fine over HTTPS the way it is currently configured. However,
here are a couple of considerations you may want to take.

1. Create your own certificate. The CentOS wiki has a guide that describes how
   to do this: https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Https . Additionally, Googling 
   "centos certificate" reveals many articles on the subject. Note that some
   third party applications, such as zmNinja, will require you to create a
   certificate different than the default certificate on your machine.

2. You can turn off HTTPS entirely by simply commenting out the SSLRequireSSL
   directives found in /etc/httpd/conf.d/zoneminder.conf. You should also
   comment out the HTTP -> HTTPS Rewrite rule.
