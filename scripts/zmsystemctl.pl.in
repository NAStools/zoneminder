=head1 NAME

zmsystemctl.pl - ZoneMinder systemctl wrapper

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 zmsystemctl.pl {start|stop|restart|version}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script allows an unpriveledged user to start, stop, or restart the
zoneminder service on a system running systemd. It does this by redirecting
commands through pkexec, which checks the available polkit policy files. The
default policy file grants the system web account user permission. This can be
changed or expanded by modifying the policy file. See man polkit for details.

=head1 SEE ALSO

polkit(8), pkexec(1)
