Mobile Devices
==============

Here are some options for using ZoneMinder on Mobile devices:

Third party mobile clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* zmNinja  (`source code <https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja>`__,  needs APIs to be installed to work)
	* Available in App Store and Play Store - `website <http://pliablepixels.github.io/zmNinja/>`__
* zmView (limited, free) and zmView Pro  (more features, paid) 
	* Available in App Store and Play Store, relies on ZM skins `website <http://html5-clouds.com/?q=node/55>`__

Using the existing web console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* You can directly use the ZoneMinder interface by launching a browser and going to the ZoneMinder server just like you do on the Desktop
* ZoneMinder also has a "mobile skin" that offers limited functionality (not all views are present in this skin). You can point your  mobile browser to ``http://yourzoneminderip/zm/index.php?skin=mobile``  and bookmark it. **Note however that 1.29 is the last release that will support the mobile skin. It's use is deprecated**
