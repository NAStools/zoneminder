Report issues/questions/feature requests on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/issues>`__

Pull requests are very welcome! If you would like to contribute, please follow the following steps.

* Fork the repo
* Open an issue at our `GitHub Issues Tracker <https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/issues>`__. Describe the bug that you've found, or the feature which you're asking for. Jot down the issue number (e.g. 456)
* Create your feature branch (``git checkout -b 456-my-new-feature``)
* Commit your changes (``git commit -m 'Added some feature'``) It is preferred that you 'commit early and often' instead of bunching all changes into a single commit.
* Push your branch to your fork on github (``git push origin 456-my-new-feature``)
* Create new Pull Request
* The team will then review, discuss and hopefully merge your changes.
